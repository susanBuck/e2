## Game planning
+ Create an array, with two elements: heads or tails
+ For Player A choose a random element from the heads/tails array
+ For Player B default to whatever move is left
+ Randomly choose from heads/tails array again to pick the winner
+ Compare the winning move against player A - if its a match, player A is the winner
+ Otherwise player B is the winner
+ In the view, report the results - player a's move, player b's move, the flip, the winner
